								<h2><u>BirdClef - 2022 Kaggle Competition</u></h2>
								<h3> Associated with San Jose State University</h3>
								<p>The BirdClef is a kaggle competition challenge that is a bioacoustic monitoring assignment that aims to provide a passive, low-labor, and cost-effective technique for analyzing endangered bird populations through their birdcalls. Species diversity and movement are monitored in almost all conservation initiatives. Long-term acoustic data analysis is essential for these efforts, but it necessitates complex algorithms that must adapt to changing environmental conditions.</p>

								<p>The goal is to develop a machine learning model to identify bird species by sound. The input is continuous audio data and the output is to recognize the species. The main challenge is to train reliable classifiers with limited training data.</p>

								<h2><u>Watch The Road</u></h2>
								<h3> Associated with San Jose State University</h3>
								<p>Distracted driving can easily cause accidents. According to National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration (NHTSA), distracted driving is causing about 3000 deaths and 280,000 injuries per year. Distracted driving has become all too common these days with advent of smart phones and social media.</p>

								<p>We believe that computer vision based solutions can be effectively used to detect inattentive drivers using any sort of dashboard cameras and alert drivers.</p>

								<h2><u>Telecom Customer Churn Modeling</u></h2>
								<h3> Associated with Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology</h3>
								<p>The telecommunication industry in the recent years is a subject of major changes and from a fast-growing industry has come to a state of saturation accompanied with strong competitive market.</p>
								<p>The aim of this project is investigating the main reasons for churn in telecommunication sector.The aim of this project is investigating the main reasons for churn in telecommunication sector.</p>
							  <p>The proposed methodology for analysis of churn prediction covers several phases: understanding the business; selection, analysis and data processing; implementing various algorithms for classification; evaluation of the classifiers and choosing the high performance model suitable for the problem.</p>
