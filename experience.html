								<h2><u>TensorFlow technical Content Writer: (August 2021 - Nov 2021)</u></h2>
								<h3> Company: Data Is Good, Mumbai, India</h3>
								<p>• Data is good is a E-learning Platform completely oriented in Data Science Field. This is an Intensive Programs backed with Industry level experts, to teach from scratch to advanced topics in the field of data science.</p>
								<p>• My role as a TensorFlow script writer in Data Is Good is one of the concrete step for me in the field of Data Science. I need to put all my knowledge about TensorFlow in the form of organized material format</p>
								<p>•	I had a chance to research about the TensorFlow which is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In this internship i had opportunity to understand in depth concepts about different neural networks like ANN,CNN,RNN,LSTM and also time-series forecasting algorithm's.</p>
								<p>•	Did an Extensive Research on the transfer learning models like Resnet50, VGG16, AlexNet, Inception model, MobileNetv2 and other models.</p>
								<p>•	I got a chance to work under senior data scientist's collaborated with data is good. under them i had understood the purpose and comparison of different neural networks. Along with that i also learnt applications of neural networks for different kinds of data.</p>
